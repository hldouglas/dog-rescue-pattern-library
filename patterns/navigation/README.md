The navigations are used to move between pages of content:

- The main-nav is used in conjunction with the header to be displayed before the banner image and about section of information.
- The card-nav is used as a secondary navigation only to be used on the home page, as it will get in the way of other content displayed on other pages.

Can style the colours of the main-nav as needed.
