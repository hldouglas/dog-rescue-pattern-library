The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention to the viewer and related back to the logo. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The standard buttons are for cards, forms, and where the background is a light colour.
- The light buttons are for dark background areas.
- The ghost buttons should be exclusively for banners where the background is an image.
- The round button is to be only used for the adding and removing of information on the forms page. It is restricted in size for a unity between the circle appearance of the button and the logo.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different of buttons.
